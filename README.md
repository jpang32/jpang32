Recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University, where I studied Computer Science and Applied Mathematics & Statistics. Internship and academic experience includes
machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and web development. Love writing efficient and clean code, solving tricky programming challenges and math 
problems, and learning about anything at the intersection of math and computer science.
